# Package in java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user-defined package.
# There are many built-in packages such as java, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, io, util, sql etc.
# There are three ways to access the package from outside the package.

2.import package.classname;
3.fully qualified name.

# If you use package.* then all the classes and interfaces of this package will be accessible but not subpackages.

# save by A.java  
package pack;  
public class A{  
  public void msg(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
}  

# save by B.java  
package mypack;  
import pack.*;  
  
class B{  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
   A obj = new A();  
   obj.msg();  
  }  
}
